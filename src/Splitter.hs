-- Currently I am thinking that downsampling, averaging and elevating again might be the
-- correct solution here.

-- What we want is a list of booleans to tell us which samples to split. We should ignore
-- massive runs of false in the array too and runs of true should end up in split files.

-- We have multiple channels, we should merge them all into the same channel by averaging
-- and then perform our logic.
