# Wavy - Haskell WAV File Parser

Decode .wav files and get the juicy PCM data inside. This project aims to make it really
easy to play with wav files in your project by extracting the relevant PCM data straight
from the file that you provide.

You can give us the file you want and we will give you access to the PCM data.
